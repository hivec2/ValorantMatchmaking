# ValorantMatchmaking
A tool to view data about your teammates and enemies in the game Valorant<br/>
<br/>Side Note (26/05/22): This tool does not currently work, but it will eventually. Im currently recoding an old project of mine that used to look like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/968437292177965157/968475575616438312/unknown.png) i have since re-designed the UI and feel i could make the project much cleaner, so thats what i plan to do in the coming days. <br/>
<br/>
Kinda sorta went ahead and got myself game banned while reversing certain parts of the game, Project frozen for 90 days. [27/05/2022]<br/>
